# Introduction

This note-book documents my learning of the zig programming language including...

- basic language constructs
- the standard library
- 3rd party tools

## What is **zig**

From **ziglang.org**

*Zig is a general-purpose programming language and toolchain for maintaining robust, optimal and reusable software.*

From **zig-book**

*Zig is a modern, low-level, and general-purpose programming language. Some programmers think of Zig as a modern and better version of C.*

## AI Assist: claude-cli

**AI** is used to assist in the creating of **zig** scripts.  There are **CLAUDE.md** files configured for zig development in each major project.
For larger projects, a project spec is first created, then scanned by the AI agent, where an implementation plan is created.  When the plan is in place
the implementation begins.  Larger projects have full unit tests and some integration tests.
