# Functional Programming

## Map/Filter/Reduce

**Main Features**:

Complete functional utilities: map, filter, reduce, and forEach
Type-generic implementations: Works with any types that satisfy the constraints
Memory management: Proper allocation/deallocation using Zig's allocator system
Comprehensive examples: Demonstrates various use cases and chaining operations

**Main Function Demonstrations**:

Basic map operation (squaring numbers)
Filter operation (getting even numbers)
Reduce operations (sum and product)
Chaining operations (filter then map)
Cross-type mapping (integers to strings)

**Test Suite**:

Tests for each functional operation
Edge case testing (empty arrays)
Memory safety verification
Type conversion testing

## Community Libraries

There are several community projects that provide functional programming utilities:

* zig-fp - A functional programming library with common FP operations
* zap - Includes some functional utilities alongside web framework features
* zig-algorithms - Contains various algorithmic implementations including functional-style operations

Zig's Approach
Zig tends to favor explicit, low-level control over high-level abstractions. The language philosophy emphasizes:

No hidden memory allocations
Explicit error handling
Compile-time evaluation where possible
Minimal runtime overhead

This means functional programming patterns are possible but require more explicit memory management compared to garbage-collected languages.
Comptime Features
Zig's comptime feature enables some functional-style metaprogramming at compile time, which can be used to generate efficient code with functional patterns.
Would you like me to show you a complete example of how to implement and use these functional operations in Zig?
