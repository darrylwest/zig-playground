# Zig Programming

Some Zig projects on GitHub to explore, ranging from beginner-friendly to advanced:

**Learning Resources:**

- **ziglings** - Interactive Zig exercises (perfect for beginners)
  - https://codeberg.org/ziglings/exercises/#ziglings
- **zig-learn** - Comprehensive Zig tutorial with examples
  - https://github.com/Sobeston/zig-learn

**CLI Tools & Utilities:**

- **zls** - Zig Language Server (official LSP implementation)
  - https://github.com/zigtools/zls
- **zig-clap** - Command line argument parsing
  - https://github.com/Hejsil/zig-clap
- **zeit** - Time tracking CLI tool
  - https://github.com/zeit-rs/zeit

**Games & Graphics:**

- **mach** - Game engine and graphics toolkit
  - https://github.com/hexops/mach
- **raylib-zig** - Zig bindings for raylib game library
  - https://github.com/Not-Nik/raylib-zig
- **tetris** - Simple Tetris implementation
  - https://github.com/andrewrk/tetris

**Web & Networking:**

- **zap** - Fast HTTP server framework
  - https://github.com/zigzap/zap
- **httpz** - HTTP server library
  - https://github.com/karlseguin/http.zig
- **zig-network** - Cross-platform networking
  - https://github.com/MasterQ32/zig-network

**System Programming:**

- **zig-sqlite** - SQLite wrapper
  - https://github.com/vrischmann/zig-sqlite
- **ziglua** - Lua bindings for Zig
  - https://github.com/natecraddock/ziglua
- **zfetch** - HTTP client library
  - https://github.com/truemedian/zfetch

**Data Structures & Algorithms:**

- **zig-toml** - TOML parser
  - https://github.com/aeronavery/zig-toml
- **zig-json** - JSON parsing examples
  - https://github.com/getty-zig/json

**Advanced Projects:**

- **bun** - JavaScript runtime (uses Zig extensively)
  - https://github.com/oven-sh/bun
- **river** - Dynamic Wayland compositor
  - https://github.com/riverwm/river

I'd recommend starting with **ziglings** if you're new to Zig - it's an excellent hands-on way to learn the language. Then explore the CLI tools and games to see real-world Zig code in action. The **mach** engine is particularly impressive for seeing what's possible with Zig in graphics programming.

Many of these projects also serve as good examples of Zig's build system (`build.zig`) and package management.
